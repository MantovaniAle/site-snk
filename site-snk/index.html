            <h3>SNK Corporation (株式会社SNK, Kabushiki-gaisha Esu Enu Kē) is a Japanese video game hardware
                and software company. It is the successor to the company Shin Nihon Kikaku and presently owns
                the SNK video game brand and the Neo Geo video game platform, and electronics. SNK's predecessor
                Shin Nihon Kikaku was founded in 1978 by Eikichi Kawasaki. The corporation was initially named Shin
                Nihon
                Kikaku (新日本企画, lit. "New Japan Project"). In 1981, the name was informally shortened to
                SNK Corporation, which became the company's official name in 1986.</h3>

            <h3>SNK is known for its creation of the Neo Geo family of arcade, home, and handheld game
                consoles in 1990. The Neo Geo line was halted in 2001 because financial troubles forced
                SNK Corporation to close in the same year. Anticipating the end of the company, established
                Playmore Corporation in 2001, which acquired all of the intellectual property of the first
                iteration of SNK Corporation. In 2003, Playmore Corporation was renamed to SNK Playmore Corporation.
                In 2016, SNK dropped the name Playmore from its logo and reintroduced its old slogan, "The Future Is
                Now",
                officially changing its corporate name back to SNK.</h3>

            <h3>SNK was founded in 1973 as Shin Nihon Kikaku and reorganized in 1978
                as a stock company (kabushiki gaisha) under the name "Shin Nihon Kikaku
                Corporation". When Eikichi Kawasaki noticed rapid growth in the coin-operated
                video game market, he expanded Shin Nihon Kikaku to include the development
                and marketing of stand-alone coin-op games.</h3>

            <h3>The company was nicknamed "Shin Nihon Kikaku" in katakana at first, but since 1981 it has been changed
                to
                "SNK"
                by taking the initials from the Roman alphabet. The English copyright notation was also
                "SNK CORPORATION".
                It established itself in Sunnyvale, California, to deliver its own brand of coin-operated games to
                arcades
                in North America. SNK chose John Rowe to head its American operation.</h3>

            <h3>The first two titles that SNK released were Ozma Wars (1979), a vertical space shooter, and Safari Rally
                (1980),
                a maze game. Game quality improved over time, most notably with Vanguard (1981), a side-scrolling space
                shooter.
                SNK licensed the game to Centuri for distribution in North America. Centuri started manufacturing and
                distributing
                the game by itself when profits exceeded projections. In part due to the success of Vanguard, SNK began
                to
                gain fame
                and reputation. An American branch opened on October 20, 1981, named SNK Electronics Corporation.</h3>
